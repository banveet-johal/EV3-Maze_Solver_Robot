# EV3-Maze_Solver_Robot

### Overview

Robot is given a starting position and the traget location. It follows the **Right-Hand Wall following algorithm** to traverse the path and return back to the starting position using the **shortest optimal path**.

### The Arena
The maze is constructed from a 4 x 6 grid of cells. Each cell has an inside dimension of 8 7/8". 
The wall of the maze are 6" high and have a thickness of approximately Â½". The Robot starts at any given cell 
A and finds the given target cell B. The maze is designed so that it contains a unique solution path. 
There will be many paths that lead to dead ends and the maze will contain a single loop that is 
not on the solution path.
